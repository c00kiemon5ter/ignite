= Ignite, a simple and robust init replacement

ignite is a set of scripts to boot Arch Linux using runit for service
supervision.

== Benefits

Robust, proven software: ignite is based on runit (which has been in
development since 2001), a high quality implementation of ideas dating
back to 1997 and earlier.

Simple configuration: ignite allows you to configure Arch using
/etc/rc.conf, like back in the old days.

Low overhead: runit-run is a tiny, statically linked binary that only
does the absolutely essential things.

Non-intrusive: ignite wont replace your cron, getty or syslog-ng.  You
are still free to do that yourself, if you want to.

Portability: the scripts can be easily adapted to other Linux
distribution, or even other unixish operating systems.

Full control: ignite will never start anything you didn't tell it
about.

== Setup

READ THIS CAREFULLY OR YOUR SYSTEM WILL NOT BOOT SUCCESSFULLY.

Install runit-musl and ignite-git from AUR.  Ensure that you have at least
one agetty-tty1 process in DAEMONS.  Note that services mentioned in
/etc/inittab will not be picked up anymore.

Reboot with "init.sysv 6" after installation if you booted with sysvinit.

== Configuration

ignite is configured using /etc/rc.conf and respects these variables:

HARDWARECLOCK=UTC|local
TIMEZONE=
KEYMAP=
CONSOLEFONT=
CONSOLEMAP=
MODULES=()  # prefix ! is not supported
USEDMRAID=no|yes
USEBTRFS=no|yes
USELVM=no|yes
HOSTNAME=   # or use /etc/hostname
DAEMONS=(alsa syslog-ng crond)  # see below, prefix ! disables

DAEMONS are checked against service directories in /etc/sv.  If they
exist, they are started, else "/etc/rc.d/$DAEMON start" is run (for
one-shot things).

== How it works

ignite uses runit, with "1 2 3"-scripts adapted from Arch initscripts
2012.05.1, back when they were plain bash scripts.  The "1 2 3"-
scripts are very straight forward, you can read them easily.

Phase 1 configures the system initially.  It can be interrupted at
almost any time by pressing C-c, which will drop you into a sulogin,
so you can change stuff.  Upon exiting this emergency shell, booting
resumes at that step

In phase 2, $DAEMONS scripts are linked to /run/service, and
runsvchdir picks them up.  You can fiddle around there yourself, but
changes won't be persistent.  Use plain "runsv /etc/sv/$DAEMON" if you
just want to try a daemon and not permanently enable it.

Use shutdown/halt/reboot to enter phase 3, which stops all services,
runs the "/etc/rc.d/$DAEMON stop" actions when needed, unmounts
everything and turns off/reboots the machine.

== Limitations

- No support for non-UTF8 environments
- No crypttab support
- No single user mode yet (but planned)
